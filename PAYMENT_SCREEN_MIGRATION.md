    amount: package.priceGHS.toString(),
    purpose: 'credit_purchase',
    purpose_id: package.id,
  },
});
```

```typescript
if (url.includes('sellar.app/payment/callback') && url.includes('status=success')) {
  verifyPayment(); // Automatic!
}
```

### **Success Flow:**
```typescript
Success → Verify → Update Credits → Show Success Screen → Navigate Back
```
