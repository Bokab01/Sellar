# ðŸ§ª Feature Implementation Test Plan

## **Complete Feature Flow Test**

### **Test Scenario: User Purchases Listing Highlight Feature**

#### **Prerequisites:**
1. User has sufficient credits (â‰¥10 credits)
2. User has at least one active listing
3. Database schema includes new fields: `highlight_until`, `urgent_until`, `boost_score`, `spotlight_until`

#### **Step-by-Step Test:**

1. **Navigate to Feature Marketplace**
   - Open app â†’ Feature Marketplace
   - Verify all 6 features are displayed:
     - Pulse Boost (15 credits)
     - Mega Pulse (50 credits) 
     - Category Spotlight (35 credits)
     - Ad Refresh (5 credits)
     - Listing Highlight (10 credits) âœ¨
     - Urgent Badge (8 credits) ðŸ”¥

2. **Purchase Listing Highlight**
   - Tap "Listing Highlight" feature
   - Verify modal shows: "Highlight listing with colored border"
   - Verify cost: 10 credits
   - Tap "Activate Feature"
   - **Expected Result**: Success message appears

3. **Verify Credit Deduction**
   - Check user credit balance
   - **Expected Result**: Balance reduced by 10 credits
   - Check credit transaction history
   - **Expected Result**: New transaction logged

4. **Verify Database Effect Applied**
   - Query listings table for user's listing
   - **Expected Result**: `highlight_until` field set to NOW() + 7 days
   - Check feature_purchases table
   - **Expected Result**: New record with status='active'

5. **Verify UI Display**
   - Navigate to Home screen
   - Find the highlighted listing
   - **Expected Result**: 
     - Listing card has golden/warning colored border
     - Enhanced shadow/glow effect
     - Listing stands out visually from others

6. **Test Urgent Badge Feature**
   - Purchase "Urgent Badge" (8 credits)
   - **Expected Result**: 
     - `urgent_until` set to NOW() + 3 days
     - Red "Urgent Sale" badge appears on listing
     - Credits deducted correctly

7. **Test Boost Features**
   - Purchase "Pulse Boost" (15 credits)
   - **Expected Result**:
     - `boost_until` set to NOW() + 24 hours
     - `boost_score` set to 200
     - "Boosted" badge appears on listing

8. **Test Feature Expiry**
   - Wait for features to expire OR manually update database
   - Run cleanup function: `SELECT * FROM cleanup_expired_features()`
   - **Expected Result**:
     - Expired features removed from listings
     - UI no longer shows expired effects
     - feature_purchases marked as 'expired'

### **Error Scenarios to Test:**

1. **Insufficient Credits**
   - Try to purchase feature with insufficient balance
   - **Expected**: Error message, no deduction, no effect applied

2. **No Listings**
   - User with no listings tries to purchase listing feature
   - **Expected**: "You need to create a listing first" message

3. **Database Errors**
   - Simulate database connection issues
   - **Expected**: Graceful error handling, no partial state

### **Performance Tests:**

1. **Multiple Features on Same Listing**
   - Apply boost + highlight + urgent badge to same listing
   - **Expected**: All effects visible simultaneously

2. **Feature Cleanup Performance**
   - Create many expired features
   - Run cleanup function
   - **Expected**: Efficient cleanup, no performance issues

### **Success Criteria:**

âœ… **Credits are deducted correctly**
âœ… **Database effects are applied immediately**  
âœ… **UI shows visual effects immediately**
âœ… **Features expire correctly**
âœ… **Error handling works properly**
âœ… **Performance is acceptable**

## **Quick Verification Commands**

```sql
-- Check if user's listing has highlight effect
SELECT id, title, highlight_until, urgent_until, boost_until, boost_score 
FROM listings 
WHERE user_id = 'USER_ID' 
AND highlight_until > NOW();

-- Check feature purchase records
SELECT feature_key, credits_spent, status, expires_at, created_at
FROM feature_purchases 
WHERE user_id = 'USER_ID' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check credit balance and transactions
SELECT balance FROM user_credits WHERE user_id = 'USER_ID';
SELECT type, amount, metadata FROM credit_transactions 
WHERE user_id = 'USER_ID' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Run feature cleanup
SELECT * FROM cleanup_expired_features();
```
