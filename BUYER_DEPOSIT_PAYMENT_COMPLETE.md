## 🔒 **Comprehensive Safety Checks**

### **Before Payment Initialization:**

#### **1. Listing Availability**
```typescript
// Re-fetch listing to ensure real-time status
- Check: status === 'active'
- Check: requires_deposit === true
- Check: quantity - reserved_quantity >= requested_quantity
```

#### **2. Offer Validity** (if from accepted offer)
```typescript
- Check: offer.status === 'accepted'
- Check: offer.awaiting_deposit === true
- Check: deposit_deadline > NOW()
```

#### **3. Duplicate Prevention**
```typescript
// Prevent buyer from paying multiple deposits for same listing
- Query existing deposits by buyer for this listing
- Block if any 'pending' or 'paid' deposits exist
```

#### **4. Concurrent Offer Protection**
```typescript
// Handle race conditions when multiple offers accepted
- RPC validates offer is still awaiting deposit
- Database transaction ensures atomic updates
- Offers past deadline auto-expire (hourly cron)
```

#### **5. Quantity Race Conditions**
```typescript
// Handle multiple buyers reserving simultaneously
- Check available_quantity in real-time
- Database constraint prevents over-reservation
- Clear error message if units already reserved
```

## 🎨 **UI State Management**

### **Buttons Hide After Payment:**

1. **Chat "Pay Deposit" Card**
   - Condition: `offer.awaiting_deposit === true`
   - Hidden when: Deposit paid (`awaiting_deposit = false`)
   - Auto-updates via: Screen refresh when returning from payment

2. **Listing Banner**
   - Condition: `acceptedOffer && acceptedOffer.awaiting_deposit`
   - Hidden when: Deposit paid or offer expired
   - Auto-updates via: `fetchAcceptedOffer()` on screen focus

3. **Regular Deposit Card**
   - Hidden when: Deposit already paid for this listing
   - Check: Query `listing_deposits` for active deposits

INSERT INTO listing_deposits (
  listing_id,
  buyer_id,
  seller_id,
  amount,
  reserved_quantity,
  offer_id,  -- ← Links deposit to offer
  status,
  ...
)
```

### **Offer State Updates:**
```sql
-- When deposit paid:
UPDATE offers
SET awaiting_deposit = FALSE
WHERE id = deposit.offer_id;

-- When deposit expires without payment:
UPDATE offers
SET status = 'expired', awaiting_deposit = FALSE
WHERE deposit_deadline < NOW();
```
