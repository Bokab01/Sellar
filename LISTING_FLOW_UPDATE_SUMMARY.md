## Summary of Changes

Successfully merged the Details step into the Category step, creating a cleaner 4-step listing creation flow.

---

## 📊 Before vs After

### **Before (5 Steps):**
1. 📷 Photos - Add photos
2. ✍️ Info - Title & description
3. 📦 Category - Category, location & attributes
4. 💰 Details - Condition, price, quantity
5. ✅ Review - Review & publish

### **After (4 Steps):**
1. 📷 Photos - Add photos
2. ✍️ Info - Title & description
3. 📋 Details - Category, location, attributes, price, quantity
4. ✅ Review - Review & publish

---

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### 1. **Updated STEPS Configuration**
```typescript
const STEPS = [
  { id: 'photos', title: 'Photos', ... },
  { id: 'basic-info', title: 'Info', ... },
  { id: 'category', title: 'Details', description: 'Category, location, price & more', ... },
  { id: 'review', title: 'Review', ... },
];
```

### 2. **Merged CategoryStep with DetailsStep**
- Moved price, quantity, and accept offers fields into CategoryStep
- Removed the separate DetailsStep component
- Added "Pricing & Details" section to CategoryStep

### 3. **Updated Validation Logic**
**File: `utils/listingValidation.ts`**
- **Case 2**: Now validates category, location, attributes, price, AND quantity (merged)
- **Case 3**: Now the Review step (was Case 4)
- Updated `validateCompleteForm` to loop through 4 steps (0-3) instead of 5

### 4. **Updated renderStepContent**
```typescript
const renderStepContent = () => {
  switch (currentStep) {
    case 0: return PhotosStep;
    case 1: return BasicInfoStep;
    case 2: return CategoryStep; // Now includes pricing & details
    case 3: return ReviewStep;
    default: return null;
  }
};
```

## ✅ Benefits

1. **Cleaner UX** - Less steps means faster listing creation
2. **Logical Grouping** - All product-specific details in one place
3. **Better Flow** - Category selection → immediately fill in price/quantity
4. **Reduced Cognitive Load** - Users see related fields together

---

## 🎯 User Flow

### Step 3 (Details) Now Contains:

#### **Category Selection**
- Category picker with hierarchical navigation
- Location picker

#### **Category Attributes** (if applicable)
- Dynamic form based on selected category
- e.g., Brand, Model, Storage for Mobile Phones
- **Condition** is now a category attribute (not separate field)

#### **Pricing & Details**
- Price input (GHS)
- Quantity stepper (1-99)
- Selling method (Fixed Price / Accept Offers)

---

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### Condition Attribute
- ✅ Condition removed from standalone "Details" step
- ✅ Condition now part of category attributes (when applicable)
- ✅ 55 categories have condition attributes
- ✅ Services, Real Estate, Jobs, etc. don't show condition (as intended)

### Validation
- All validation rules maintained
- Step indices updated (step 3 = old step 3 + old step 4)
- Review step moved from index 4 → 3
