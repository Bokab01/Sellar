## 💾 Storage Routing Strategy

| Content Type | Storage | Reason |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| Profile Images | Supabase | Low volume, auth integration |
| Listing Images | R2 (Secure) | High volume, cost savings |
| Community Posts | R2 (Secure) | High volume, cost savings |
| Chat Attachments | R2 (Secure) | High volume, cost savings |
| Videos | Supabase | Memory constraints (temporary) |
| Verification Docs | R2 (Private) | Compliance, signed URLs |

## 📊 Monitoring Setup

### Daily Checks:
- Edge Function error rate (should be <1%)
- R2 storage growth
- Upload success rate

### Weekly Checks:
- Total costs (R2 + Edge Functions)
- Audit log for anomalies
- User upload patterns

### Monthly Checks:
- Cost optimization opportunities
- Security review
- Performance metrics

### Alerts to Set:
- R2 storage > 100GB
- Edge Function errors > 100/day
- Unusual upload spikes
- Cost > expected
