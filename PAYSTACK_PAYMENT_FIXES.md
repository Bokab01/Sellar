# Paystack Payment Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Credits Not Added After Payment
**Problem:** After successful payment, Paystack sent confirmation email but credits weren't added to user account.

**Root Cause:** The `paystack-verify` Edge Function was calling a non-existent `complete_credit_purchase` RPC function.

**Solution:** 
- Updated `paystack-verify/index.ts` to directly add credits to user's profile
- Implemented proper credit addition logic:
  - Gets current balance from `profiles` table
  - Calculates new balance
  - Updates user's credits atomically
  - Records transaction in `credit_transactions` table
  - Sends success notification

**Changes Made:**
- `supabase/functions/paystack-verify/index.ts` - Lines 193-285
  - Replaced non-existent RPC call with direct database operations
  - Added proper balance tracking (balance_before, balance_after)
  - Added notification creation with credits count

### 2. ✅ No Navigation After Payment
**Problem:** After successful payment, user remained on payment screen instead of being navigated back.

**Solution:**
- Updated `handlePaymentSuccess` in `app/buy-credits.tsx`
- Now immediately refreshes credits (they're already added by `paystack-verify`)
- Shows success toast with credit count
- Navigates back after 1.5 seconds using `router.back()`

**Changes Made:**
- `app/buy-credits.tsx` - Lines 109-121
  - Added `async` to payment success handler
  - Added immediate `await refreshCredits()`
  - Added `router.back()` with 1.5s delay

---

### 3. ✅ Added Purchase Confirmation Modal
**Problem:** No confirmation before payment, users could accidentally purchase.

**Solution:**
- Added `AppModal` confirmation dialog before initiating payment
- Shows package details: name, credits, price
- Explains redirection to Paystack
- Has clear "Confirm Payment" and "Cancel" buttons

**Changes Made:**
- `app/buy-credits.tsx` - Added:
  - `showConfirmModal` state (line 42)
  - `pendingPackage` state (line 43)
  - `handleConfirmPurchase` function (lines 75-107)
  - Updated `handlePurchase` to show modal instead of immediately processing (lines 60-73)
  - Confirmation modal UI (lines 489-544)

## Testing

### Test the complete flow:

1. **Open Buy Credits Screen**
   - Navigate to buy credits
   - Select a package (e.g., Starter - 120 credits)

2. **Confirm Purchase**
   - ✅ Confirmation modal should appear
   - ✅ Shows package name, credits, and price
   - ✅ Has "Confirm Payment" and "Cancel" buttons

3. **Complete Payment**
   - Press "Confirm Payment"
   - ✅ Redirects to Paystack payment page
   - Complete payment with test card:
     ```
     Card: 5060 6666 6666 6666 666
     Expiry: Any future date
     CVV: 123
     PIN: 1234
     ```

4. **Verify Results**
   - ✅ Success toast appears with credit count
   - ✅ Credits are added immediately to account
   - ✅ Automatically navigates back after 1.5s
   - ✅ Balance is updated on wallet/dashboard
   - ✅ Notification is sent about purchase

## Database Verification

Check if payment was processed correctly:

```sql
-- Check latest transaction
SELECT * FROM paystack_transactions 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;

-- Check credit transaction record
SELECT * FROM credit_transactions 
WHERE type = 'purchase' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;

-- Check user's current balance
SELECT credits FROM profiles 
WHERE id = 'your-user-id';

-- Check notification
SELECT * FROM notifications 
WHERE type = 'payment_success' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```
