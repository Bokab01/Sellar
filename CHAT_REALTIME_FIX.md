# Chat Real-Time Subscription Fix

## Problem
Messages were not appearing in real-time in the chat detail screen. Users had to navigate away and back to see new messages.

## Root Cause
The `useRealtime` hook had a critical dependency management issue:

1. **Unstable Dependencies**: The `setupChannel` function was included in the `useEffect` cleanup dependencies
2. **Recreation Loop**: `setupChannel` depended on `reconnectChannel`, which depended on `table` and `filter`
3. **Premature Cleanup**: When dependencies changed, the effect would clean up the channel and try to recreate it, but the check `if (channelRef.current)` would prevent re-subscription
4. **Missing Logs**: There was no visibility into what was happening with the subscriptions

## Solution Applied

### 1. Stabilized Functions Using Refs
- Moved `table` and `filter` values to refs (`tableRef`, `filterRef`)
- Made `setupChannel` and `reconnectChannel` stable functions with minimal dependencies
- Functions now read current values from refs instead of capturing them in closures

### 2. Fixed useEffect Dependencies
```typescript
// Before:
}, [table, filter, setupChannel]);  // setupChannel was causing re-runs

// After:
}, [table, filter]);  // Only re-run when table/filter actually change
```

### 3. Added Comprehensive Logging
All subscription events now log:
- âœ… Channel creation
- âœ… Subscription status (SUBSCRIBED, CHANNEL_ERROR, TIMED_OUT, CLOSED)
- âœ… Message/event reception
- âœ… Reconnection attempts
- âœ… Cleanup operations

## How to Test

### 1. Check Console Logs
When you open a chat, you should see:
```
ðŸ”— Setting up chat real-time for conversation: <id>
ðŸ”— Initializing realtime for table: messages
ðŸ”— Creating new channel: realtime-messages-<timestamp>-<id> with filter: conversation_id=eq.<id>
âœ… Successfully subscribed to messages changes
```

### 2. Send a Message from Another Device/User
- Open the chat on Device A
- Send a message from Device B (or another user)
- The message should appear immediately on Device A without any manual refresh
- You should see in console:
```
ðŸ”— messages event received: INSERT {payload}
ðŸ”— Real-time message insert received: {message}
ðŸ”— Fetched complete message data: {complete data}
```

### 3. Test Reconnection
- Put app in background
- Wait 30 seconds
- Bring app back to foreground
- You should see:
```
ðŸ”— App became active, checking channel state for messages
ðŸ”— Current channel state: joined
```
