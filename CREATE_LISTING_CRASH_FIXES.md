# 🔧 Create Listing Screen - Crash Fixes Summary

## ✅ Fixed: 5 Critical Issues

### 1. **Infinite Re-Render Loop in Autosave** (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** `JSON.stringify(formData)` was being called on every render, and `saveDraft` was in the dependency array, causing infinite loops.

**Fix:**
- Removed `saveDraft` from `useEffect` dependencies in `hooks/useListingAutosave.ts`
- Added `// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` comment for clarity
- The `saveDraft` function is stable via `useCallback` with proper dependencies

**File:** `hooks/useListingAutosave.ts`

---

### 2. **Memory Leak in CategoryAttributesForm** (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** `fetchAttributes` function was defined outside `useEffect` but not included in dependencies, causing stale closures and potential memory leaks. Also, no cleanup for unmounted components.

**Fix:**
- Moved `fetchAttributes` inside `useEffect`
- Added `isMounted` flag to prevent state updates on unmounted components
- Added cleanup function: `return () => { isMounted = false; }`
- Added early return if `!categoryId`

**File:** `components/CategoryAttributesForm.tsx`

---

### 3. **Image Memory Issues** (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem:** Multiple large images being rendered without optimization, causing memory pressure on mobile devices.

**Fix:**
- Added `.slice(0, 8)` to limit rendered images in preview
- Added `defaultSource` prop to Image components for graceful fallback
- Limited thumbnail size to 80x80 to reduce memory footprint

**File:** `app/(tabs)/create/index.tsx` (lines 1100-1120)

---

### 4. **Missing Error Boundary for Category Form** (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem:** CategoryAttributesForm could crash the entire screen if category attributes failed to load or had invalid data.

**Fix:**
- Wrapped `CategoryAttributesForm` in `CreateListingErrorBoundary`
- Added enhanced error logging in `componentDidCatch` with structured error logs
- Error boundary now shows full error message, stack trace, and component stack

**File:** `app/(tabs)/create/index.tsx` (lines 906-913, 2551-2567)

---

### 5. **Incorrect useCallback Dependency** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Problem:** `handleCategorySelect` had `updateFormData` in dependencies instead of `updateMultipleFields`, causing stale references.

**Fix:**
- Changed dependency from `updateFormData` to `updateMultipleFields`

**File:** `app/(tabs)/create/index.tsx` (line 718)

## 📊 Performance Improvements

| Issue | Severity | Impact | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Autosave infinite loop | 🔴 Critical | App freezes/crashes | ✅ Fixed |
| CategoryForm memory leak | 🔴 Critical | Crashes on category change | ✅ Fixed |
| Image memory pressure | 🟠 High | Crashes with many images | ✅ Fixed |
| Missing error boundary | 🟠 High | Full screen crash | ✅ Fixed |
| Stale callback dependency | 🟡 Medium | Inconsistent behavior | ✅ Fixed |

## 🔍 How to Monitor for Future Crashes

### 1. **Check Console Logs**
Look for these indicators:
```
🚨 CreateListing Error Boundary caught an error:
📍 Error info:
📚 Component stack:
🔍 Full error log:
```

### 2. **Common Crash Patterns**
- **Memory crashes**: Look for "out of memory" errors when uploading multiple large images
- **Category crashes**: Check if errors occur immediately after selecting a category
- **Input crashes**: Verify if crashes happen while typing in text fields
- **Autosave crashes**: Watch for freezing or lag 2 seconds after typing stops

### 3. **Development Monitoring**
Enable React Native performance monitor:
- On Android: Shake device → "Show Perf Monitor"
- On iOS: Shake device → "Show Perf Monitor"

Watch for:
- **JS FPS < 30**: Indicates performance issues
- **Memory > 500MB**: Potential memory leak
- **UI Thread dropping frames**: Re-render issues

## 🚀 Testing Checklist

Before marking as resolved, test these scenarios:

- [ ] Upload 8 photos and switch between steps - should not crash
- [ ] Select different categories rapidly - should not crash
- [ ] Type quickly in title/description fields - autosave should not cause lag
- [ ] Put app in background for 30s, return - should not crash
- [ ] Fill out form completely and submit - should complete successfully
- [ ] Select category with many attributes (e.g., "Mobile Phones") - should load without crashing
- [ ] Test on low-end Android device (< 2GB RAM) - should handle memory gracefully

## 📝 Additional Recommendations

### Short Term (Optional but Recommended):
1. **Add Sentry crash reporting** to production for real-time crash alerts
2. **Implement image compression** before upload to reduce memory usage
3. **Add loading skeletons** for CategoryAttributesForm to improve perceived performance

### Long Term (Future Optimization):
1. **Virtualize image picker** to only render visible images
2. **Implement React.memo** for heavy components like ReviewStep
3. **Use React DevTools Profiler** to identify remaining re-render issues
4. **Consider chunked autosave** to reduce JSON.stringify operations on large forms

---

## 🎯 Expected Outcome

After these fixes:
- ✅ No more unexpected app closures during listing creation
- ✅ Smooth autosave without freezing
- ✅ Stable category attribute loading
- ✅ Better memory management with multiple images
- ✅ Graceful error handling with clear error messages

## 🐛 If Crashes Still Occur

If the app still crashes after these fixes, collect this information:

1. **Exact steps to reproduce**
2. **Device model and OS version**
3. **Number of images uploaded**
4. **Selected category**
5. **Console logs** (especially errors with 🚨 emoji)
6. **Memory usage** (from Performance Monitor)

Then check:
- Is it a specific category causing the issue?
- Does it crash with 1 image vs 8 images?
- Does it crash on autosave or manual submission?
- Is it happening in development or production (or both)?

## 🆕 Bonus Fixes: Additional Crash Prevention

### 6. **Undefined Images Array in Listing Detail** (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** `listing.images.map()` was called without checking if `listing.images` is actually an array, causing "listing.images.map is not a function" crash.

**Fix:**
- Changed condition from `listing.images && listing.images.length > 0` 
- To: `listing.images && Array.isArray(listing.images) && listing.images.length > 0`
- Ensures `images` is actually an array before attempting to call `.map()` or `.length`

**File:** `app/(tabs)/home/[id].tsx` (line 1579)

---

### 7. **Undefined Media Array in MediaViewer** (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** `media.map()` was called without checking if `media` prop is defined and is an array, causing "media.map is not a function" crash when opening image viewer.

**Fix:**
- Added early return with comprehensive safety check:
  ```typescript
  if (!visible || !media || !Array.isArray(media) || media.length === 0) {
    return null;
  }
  ```
- Prevents MediaViewer from rendering with invalid data

**File:** `components/MediaViewer/MediaViewer.tsx` (line 431)
