# âœ… Reserved Status System - Setup Complete

## Overview

The Reserved Status System has been successfully implemented and deployed. This system protects sellers from losing boosts when deals fall through while maintaining buyer commitment.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What's Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- âœ… `reserved_until` - Timestamp when reservation expires (48 hours)
- âœ… `reserved_for` - Buyer's user ID
- âœ… `reservation_count` - Analytics tracking
- âœ… Indexes for performance

### 2. Database Functions
- âœ… `auto_recover_expired_reservations()` - Recovers listings when reservations expire
- âœ… `cancel_reservation()` - Manual cancellation
- âœ… `notify_expired_reservations()` - Sends notifications before expiry

### 3. Automation (Cron Job)
- âœ… Supabase Edge Function deployed
- âœ… cron-job.org configured (runs every hour)
- âœ… Auto-recovery active
- âœ… Expiry notifications active

### 4. Mobile App Integration
- âœ… Offer acceptance sets status to 'reserved'
- âœ… Transaction confirmation marks as 'sold'
- âœ… Listing detail screen shows reservation status
- âœ… My Listings shows reserved items
- âœ… Relist functionality for sold items

### 5. Helper Functions
- âœ… `getListingStatusBadge()` - UI badge display
- âœ… `getListingStatusText()` - User-friendly text with countdown
- âœ… `isListingActive()` - Status checks
- âœ… `isListingReserved()` - Status checks

---

## ðŸ”„ How It Works

### When Offer is Accepted:
```
1. Listing status â†’ 'reserved'
2. reserved_until â†’ NOW() + 48 hours
3. reserved_for â†’ buyer_id
4. reservation_count â†’ +1
5. System message sent to chat
```

### During 48-Hour Window:
```
1. Listing appears as "Reserved" in UI
2. Countdown timer shows time remaining
3. Transaction completion button in chat
4. 1 hour before expiry â†’ notifications sent
```

### When Both Parties Confirm:
```
1. Listing status â†’ 'sold'
2. reserved_until â†’ NULL
3. reserved_for â†’ NULL
4. Boosts preserved (not lost)
5. Review system activated
```

### If Reservation Expires:
```
1. Auto-recovery runs (hourly cron job)
2. Listing status â†’ 'active'
3. reserved_until â†’ NULL
4. reserved_for â†’ NULL
5. Listing returns to marketplace
6. Boosts preserved (not lost)
```

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring

### Check Active Reservations:
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  title,
  status,
  reserved_until,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (reserved_until - NOW()))/3600 as hours_remaining
FROM listings
WHERE status = 'reserved'
ORDER BY reserved_until;
```

### Check Recovery Statistics:
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'sold' THEN 1 END) as completed_transactions,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'active' AND reservation_count > 0 THEN 1 END) as recovered_listings,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'reserved' THEN 1 END) as currently_reserved,
  COUNT(*) as total_ever_reserved
FROM listings
WHERE reservation_count > 0;
```

### Check Cron Job Status:
- **cron-job.org**: https://cron-job.org (check execution history)
- **Supabase Logs**: Dashboard â†’ Edge Functions â†’ auto-recover-reservations â†’ Logs

---

## ðŸ”§ Maintenance

### Manual Recovery (if needed):
```sql
-- Recover a specific listing
SELECT cancel_reservation('listing-uuid-here');

-- Recover all expired reservations immediately
SELECT auto_recover_expired_reservations();

-- Send expiry notifications immediately
SELECT notify_expired_reservations();
```

### Update Reservation Duration:
If you want to change from 48 hours to a different duration, update in:
- `app/(tabs)/inbox/[id].tsx` (line ~850): `reservedUntil.setHours(reservedUntil.getHours() + 48);`

---

## ðŸ“± User Experience

### For Sellers:
1. Accepts offer â†’ Listing reserved for 48 hours
2. Receives notification 1 hour before expiry
3. If deal completes â†’ Listing marked as sold, boosts preserved
4. If deal fails â†’ Listing auto-relists, boosts preserved
5. Can relist sold items manually

### For Buyers:
1. Offer accepted â†’ Has 48 hours to complete
2. Receives notification 1 hour before expiry
3. Transaction button in chat
4. Must confirm transaction within window
