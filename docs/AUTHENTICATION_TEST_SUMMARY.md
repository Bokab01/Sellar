- Token refresh maintains session continuity

### 3. Authentication Security Tests (`auth-security.test.ts`)
**Purpose**: Tests security features, validation, and protection mechanisms.

**Key Features Tested**:
- ✅ Rate limiting for login attempts
- ✅ Password strength calculation and validation

- ✅ Security event audit logging

**Critical Validations**:
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- Password strength scoring works correctly (0-5 scale)
- Common password patterns are detected and flagged
- Session tokens are cryptographically secure (32 characters, base64)
- Expired and idle sessions are properly cleaned up
- Suspicious activities trigger appropriate security responses
- Input sanitization prevents SQL injection and XSS attacks
- Device fingerprinting generates unique identifiers
- Geographic anomalies are detected for security

### 4. Authentication Integration Tests (`auth-integration.test.ts`)
**Purpose**: Tests integration between authentication components and external services.

**Key Features Tested**:
- ✅ Complete user onboarding journey
- ✅ Multi-step registration with validation
- ✅ Email verification integration
- ✅ Profile creation and management
- ✅ Social authentication flows
- ✅ Third-party service integration
- ✅ Error recovery and retry mechanisms
- ✅ Cross-component data flow

**Critical Validations**:
- End-to-end user onboarding works seamlessly
- Email verification integrates properly with external services
- Profile data is correctly created and validated
- Social authentication flows handle OAuth properly
- Error recovery mechanisms work for network failures
- Data flows correctly between authentication components

## Key Security Features Validated

### Rate Limiting
- ✅ 5 login attempts per 15-minute window
- ✅ Automatic lockout and cooldown periods
- ✅ IP-based and user-based rate limiting

### Password Security
- ✅ Minimum 8 characters with complexity requirements
- ✅ Strength scoring algorithm (0-5 scale)
- ✅ Common pattern detection (dictionary words, sequences)
- ✅ Secure password reset with time-limited tokens

### Session Management
- ✅ Secure token generation (cryptographically random)
- ✅ Automatic session expiry (configurable timeouts)
- ✅ Concurrent session limits and management
- ✅ Session cleanup for expired/idle sessions

### Input Validation
- ✅ SQL injection prevention through input sanitization
- ✅ XSS attack prevention with HTML encoding
- ✅ Email format validation with regex patterns
- ✅ Phone number format validation

### Device Security
- ✅ Device fingerprinting for anomaly detection
- ✅ Location-based security checks
- ✅ Suspicious activity scoring and alerts

## Files Created/Modified

### Test Files Created
- `__tests__/auth/auth-store.test.ts` - Authentication store testing
- `__tests__/auth/auth-flows.test.ts` - End-to-end flow testing
- `__tests__/auth/auth-security.test.ts` - Security feature testing
- `__tests__/auth/auth-integration.test.ts` - Integration testing

### Key Components Tested
- `store/useAuthStore.ts` - Zustand authentication store

## Issues Resolved During Testing

### TypeScript Errors Fixed
- ✅ Optional chaining for potentially undefined properties
- ✅ Proper type annotations for mock data and test objects
- ✅ Null safety checks for user input validation

### Test Logic Corrections
- ✅ Password strength calculation ranges adjusted for realistic scoring

- ✅ Rate limiting prevents abuse and attacks
- ✅ Audit logging for security events

## Next Steps Recommendations
Based on the successful authentication testing, the following areas are recommended for next priority:

1. **Search and Discovery System** - Test advanced search, filtering, and ranking
2. **Payment Processing Integration** - Test Paystack integration and transaction flows
3. **Push Notifications System** - Test notification delivery and management
4. **User Verification Flows** - Test document upload and verification processes
5. **Community Features** - Test posts, interactions, and social features

## Conclusion
