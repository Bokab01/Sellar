## üîß **Pre-Deployment Steps**

### 1. **Database Migration** ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED
```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd C:\Users\oseik\Desktop\Sellar-mobile-app

# Deploy migration to Supabase
supabase db push

# Or manually run the migration file in Supabase Dashboard
# File: supabase/migrations/20250201000001_add_physical_shop_features.sql
```

**Verify Migration Success:**
- [ ] `profiles` table has new columns: `business_address`, `business_latitude`, `business_longitude`, etc.
- [ ] `business_photos` table exists with correct schema
- [ ] `listings` table has pickup columns: `pickup_available`, `pickup_preparation_time`, etc.
- [ ] RPC functions exist: `calculate_distance`, `find_nearby_shops`, `is_shop_open`

### 2. **Storage Bucket Setup** ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED
```sql
-- Verify bucket exists
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE name = 'shops-images';

-- If not exists, create it via Supabase Dashboard:
-- 1. Go to Storage > Create new bucket
-- 2. Name: shops-images
-- 3. Public: true
-- 4. File size limit: 5MB
-- 5. Allowed MIME types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp
```

**Set RLS Policies for `shops-images` bucket:**
```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload shop photos"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'shops-images' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

-- Allow public read access
CREATE POLICY "Shop photos are publicly accessible"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'shops-images');

-- Allow users to delete their own photos
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own shop photos"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'shops-images' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
```

### 3. **Environment Configuration**
- [ ] Verify `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` is set correctly
- [ ] Verify `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is set correctly
- [ ] No additional environment variables needed

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

### **Pro Seller Requirements**
Physical shop features are ONLY available to:
- ‚úÖ Users with active Sellar Pro subscription (`subscription_status = 'active'`)
- ‚úÖ OR users in trial period (`subscription_status = 'trialing'`)

**Verification Logic:**
```typescript
// Check if user can access physical shop features
const canAccessShopFeatures = hasBusinessPlan() && 
  (profile?.subscription_status === 'active' || profile?.subscription_status === 'trialing');
```

### **Pickup Availability Logic**
A listing shows pickup banner when:
1. `listing.pickup_available = true` (set by seller)
2. Seller has `has_physical_shop = true` in their profile
3. Listing is `status = 'active'`
4. Not viewing own listing (buyers only)

### **Shop Auto-Status Update**
The trigger `update_has_physical_shop` automatically sets `has_physical_shop = true` when:
- `business_latitude` AND `business_longitude` are not null
- This happens automatically on wizard publish

### **Business Hours RPC**
The `is_shop_open` function checks:
- Current day of week
- Current time in UTC
- Returns `true` if shop is open NOW

## üêõ **Known Limitations**

1. **Distance Calculation**
   - Utility function created (`utils/distanceCalculation.ts`)
   - Not yet displayed in UI on listing cards (intentionally skipped per user request)
   - Can be easily added later using the utility

2. **Web App**
   - Physical shop features NOT implemented for web yet
   - Mobile app only for now
   - Web app marked as future enhancement

3. **Real-Time Open Status**
   - `is_shop_open` RPC checks UTC time
   - Assumes Ghana timezone (UTC+0)
   - Works correctly but doesn't account for daylight saving (Ghana doesn't observe DST)
