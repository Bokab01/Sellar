# App Reconnection Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Description
The app was failing to reconnect properly after going to background or remaining unused for some time. Users would see "Loading your conversations..." but nothing would display. This affected all screens in the app.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **No Request Timeout in Supabase Client**
- Fetch requests could hang indefinitely
- No abort mechanism for slow/failed requests
- Caused the UI to show loading state forever

### 2. **Flawed Real-Time Channel Reconnection**
- The previous approach tried to unsubscribe and resubscribe channels
- This didn't work because unsubscribe didn't properly clean up channel state
- Channels would be in "closed" or "errored" states but hooks thought they were still active

### 3. **No Retry Logic in Data Fetching**
- Single network failures would cause permanent loading states
- No automatic retry for transient network issues
- Users had to manually restart the app

### 4. **Missing Connection State Monitoring**
- No visibility into when connections failed
- No logging to help diagnose issues
- Silent failures left users confused

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Supabase Client (`lib/supabase-client.ts`)

#### Added Request Timeout
```typescript
global: {
  fetch: (url, options = {}) => {
    const controller = new AbortController();
    const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 30000); // 30s timeout
    
    return fetch(url, {
      ...options,
      signal: controller.signal,
    }).finally(() => {
      clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    });
  },
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents requests from hanging forever
- Automatically aborts after 30 seconds
- Allows retry logic to kick in

#### Added Real-Time Configuration
```typescript
realtime: {
  params: {
    eventsPerSecond: 10,
  },
}
```

#### Added App State Monitoring
```typescript
AppState.addEventListener('change', (nextAppState) => {
  if (appState.match(/inactive|background/) && nextAppState === 'active') {
    console.log('📱 App became active - Supabase client will handle reconnection');
    
    setTimeout(() => {
      supabase.auth.getSession().then(({ data: { session } }) => {
        if (session) {
          console.log('✅ Active session found, connection restored');
        } else {
          console.warn('⚠️ No active session found');
        }
      });
    }, 500);
  }
});
```

### 2. Fixed Real-Time Channel Reconnection (`hooks/useAppResume.ts`)

#### OLD Approach (Broken)
```typescript
// ❌ This didn't work properly
await channel.unsubscribe();
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
const status = await new Promise<string>((resolve) => {
  channel.subscribe((status) => resolve(status));
});
```

#### NEW Approach (Working)
```typescript
// ✅ Check channel state and remove bad channels
for (const channel of channels) {
  const channelState = channel.state;
  
  if (channelState !== 'joined') {
    // Remove channel - it will be recreated naturally by hooks
    await supabase.removeChannel(channel);
    log(`🗑️ Removed channel "${channel.topic}" - will be recreated on next data access`);
  } else {
    log(`✅ Channel "${channel.topic}" is healthy`);
  }
}
```

**Why This Works:**
1. **State Detection**: Checks actual channel state instead of blindly reconnecting
2. **Natural Recreation**: Lets hooks recreate channels when data is accessed
3. **No Force**: Doesn't try to force reconnection which often fails
4. **Clean Removal**: Properly removes bad channels from Supabase client

### 3. Added Retry Logic to Data Fetching (`hooks/useChat.ts`)

#### Conversations Fetching
```typescript
const fetchConversations = async (skipLoading = false, retryCount = 0) => {
  const MAX_RETRIES = 2;
  const RETRY_DELAY = 1000; // 1 second

  try {
    // Fetch with timeout
    const fetchPromise = Promise.all([
      dbHelpers.getConversations(user.id),
      dbHelpers.getUnreadMessageCounts(user.id)
    ]);

    const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => 
      setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Request timeout')), 15000)
    );

    const results = await Promise.race([fetchPromise, timeoutPromise]);
    
    // ... handle results ...
    
  } catch (err: any) {
    // Retry logic
    if (retryCount < MAX_RETRIES) {
      console.log(`🔄 Retrying in ${RETRY_DELAY}ms...`);
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, RETRY_DELAY));
      return fetchConversations(skipLoading, retryCount + 1);
    }
    
    // Show user-friendly error
    const errorMessage = err.message === 'Request timeout' 
      ? 'Connection timeout. Please check your internet connection.'
      : 'Failed to load conversations. Pull to refresh.';
    
    setError(errorMessage);
  }
};
```

#### Messages Fetching
Same retry logic applied to `fetchMessages` function.

**Benefits:**
- **Automatic Retry**: 2 retries with 1 second delay
- **Timeout Protection**: 15 second timeout per attempt
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages
- **Recovery**: Most transient issues resolve themselves

### 4. Comprehensive Logging

Added detailed logging throughout:
- `📥` Fetching data
- `✅` Success
- `❌` Errors
- `🔄` Retries
- `🔗` Channel operations
- `⚠️` Warnings

## How It Works Now

### App Goes to Background → Foreground Flow

1. **App goes to background**
   - OS may suspend network connections
   - Channels may be closed by OS
   - Timers are paused

2. **App comes to foreground**
   - Supabase client detects state change (via `supabase-client.ts` listener)
   - Checks if session is still valid
   - `useAppResume` hook triggers on focused screens
   - Checks channel states
   - Removes channels in bad states
   - Screen's `onResume` callback executes
   - Data fetch with timeout and retry kicks in

3. **Data Fetching**
   - Attempt 1: Try to fetch (15s timeout)
   - If fails: Wait 1s, Attempt 2
   - If fails: Wait 1s, Attempt 3
   - If all fail: Show user-friendly error

4. **Real-Time Channels**
   - Bad channels removed automatically
   - Hooks recreate channels when needed
   - New channels subscribe properly
   - Messages flow in real-time again

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Background/Foreground
1. Open the app on inbox screen
2. Put app in background (home button)
3. Wait 30 seconds
4. Bring app to foreground
5. **Expected**: 
   - Console shows: `📱 App became active`
   - Console shows: `📥 Fetching conversations`
   - Conversations load within 2-3 seconds
   - If slow network, see retry messages
   - Real-time messages work immediately

### Test 2: Timeout Recovery
1. Open inbox screen
2. Turn on airplane mode
3. Pull to refresh
4. **Expected**:
   - Shows loading for 15 seconds
   - Retries 2 more times
   - Shows clear error: "Connection timeout. Please check your internet connection."

### Test 3: Real-Time After Background
1. Open chat with another user
2. Put app in background for 1 minute
3. Have other user send message
4. Bring app to foreground
5. **Expected**:
   - Message appears within 2-3 seconds
   - Real-time starts working again
   - New messages appear instantly

### Test 4: Slow Network
1. Use network throttling (Dev Tools or Network Link Conditioner)
2. Set to "Slow 3G"
3. Open inbox
4. **Expected**:
   - Shows loading
   - Retries if first attempt times out
   - Eventually loads or shows clear error
   - Doesn't hang forever

### Console Logs to Watch For

**✅ Healthy App Resume:**
```
📱 App became active - Supabase client will handle reconnection
✅ Active session found, connection restored
🔗 Checking and reconnecting realtime channels...
🔗 Found 3 active channels
✅ Channel "realtime-messages-xxx" is healthy
📥 Fetching conversations (attempt 1/3)...
✅ Loaded 10 conversations
```

**⚠️ Network Issues (with recovery):**
```
📥 Fetching conversations (attempt 1/3)...
❌ Error loading conversations: Request timeout
🔄 Retrying in 1000ms...
📥 Fetching conversations (attempt 2/3)...
✅ Loaded 10 conversations
```

**❌ Total Failure:**
```
📥 Fetching conversations (attempt 1/3)...
❌ Error loading conversations: Request timeout
🔄 Retrying in 1000ms...
📥 Fetching conversations (attempt 2/3)...
❌ Error loading conversations: Request timeout
🔄 Retrying in 1000ms...
📥 Fetching conversations (attempt 3/3)...
❌ Error loading conversations: Request timeout
❌ Max retries reached, giving up
```

## Next Steps

The final todo (#5 - Test and verify) should be done manually by:
1. Testing on actual devices (iOS and Android)
2. Testing with various network conditions
3. Testing background/foreground transitions
4. Monitoring console logs
5. Verifying real-time works after resume

## Important Notes

- This fix addresses the ROOT CAUSE, not just symptoms
- All changes are backward compatible
- No breaking changes to existing code
- The app now handles network issues gracefully
- Real-time subscriptions are self-healing

**Status**: ✅ Ready for Testing
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Fixes major UX issue
