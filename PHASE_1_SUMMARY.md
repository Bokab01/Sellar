## üì¶ Deliverables

### 1. **Database Migration** ‚úÖ
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250201000001_add_physical_shop_features.sql`

**New Tables:**
- `business_photos` - Shop photo gallery (5 photos per shop)

**Enhanced Tables:**
- `profiles` - Added 12 physical shop fields
- `listings` - Added 4 pickup-related fields

**Helper Functions:**
- `calculate_distance()` - Haversine formula for lat/long distance
- `find_nearby_shops()` - Find shops within radius
- `is_shop_open()` - Real-time business hours check

**Database Features:**
- Spatial indexes for fast location queries
- RLS policies for security
- Triggers for automation
- Constraints for data validation
- View for optimized shop queries

---

### 2. **TypeScript Types** ‚úÖ
**File:** `lib/database.types.ts`

**Updated Types:**
- ‚úÖ `profiles` - Physical shop fields typed
- ‚úÖ `business_photos` - New table fully typed
- ‚úÖ `listings` - Pickup fields typed

All types support:
- Row (SELECT queries)
- Insert (INSERT operations)
- Update (UPDATE operations)

---

### 3. **Documentation** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ `PHYSICAL_SHOP_FEATURE_PLAN.md` - Complete implementation plan
- ‚úÖ `PHASE_1_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step deployment
- ‚úÖ `PHASE_1_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Capabilities Enabled

### For Developers:
‚úÖ Query shops by distance from any coordinate  
‚úÖ Check if shop is open in real-time  
‚úÖ Store multiple shop photos per seller  
‚úÖ Enable pickup on individual listings  
‚úÖ Calculate distances for sorting/filtering  

### For Future Features:
‚úÖ "Shops Near Me" map view

## üìä Infrastructure Cost

**Current (Phase 1):** $0/month  
- No map API calls yet (Phase 3+)
- Storage within free tier
- Database changes minimal

**Expected (Full Feature):** $15-30/month  
- Static map images
- Geocoding API
- Still well within budget

---

## üéØ What's Next?

### Phase 2: Seller Setup Experience (Weeks 3-4)
**Goal:** Enable Pro sellers to configure their shop

**Key Features:**
- Shop setup wizard
- Address input with autocomplete
- Map location picker
- Business hours editor
- Shop photo uploader

**UI Components to Build:**
- `ShopSetupWizard`
- `AddressInput`
- `LocationPicker`
- `BusinessHoursEditor`
- `ShopPhotoGallery`

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

Before moving to Phase 2, test:

### Database Tests:
- [ ] Create shop with all fields
- [ ] Upload 5 shop photos
- [ ] Calculate distance between two points
- [ ] Find shops within 10km radius
- [ ] Check business hours (open/closed)
- [ ] Create listing with pickup enabled

### Performance Tests:
- [ ] Query 1000+ profiles (should be fast)
- [ ] Spatial index usage verified
- [ ] Triggers execute in <1ms

### Security Tests:
- [ ] RLS blocks unauthorized photo access
- [ ] Constraints prevent invalid coordinates
- [ ] Triggers work for all update scenarios

## üí° Developer Notes

### Working with Physical Shops

**Check if user has physical shop:**
```typescript
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('has_physical_shop, business_latitude, business_longitude')
  .eq('id', userId)
  .single();

if (data?.has_physical_shop) {
  // Show shop features
}
```

**Find nearby shops:**
```typescript
const { data } = await supabase
  .rpc('find_nearby_shops', {
    p_latitude: userLat,
    p_longitude: userLng,
    p_radius_km: 10,
    p_limit: 20
  });
```

**Check if open:**
```typescript
const { data } = await supabase
  .rpc('is_shop_open', {
    p_user_id: shopId
  });
```

**Upload shop photo:**
```typescript
// 1. Upload to storage
const { data: file } = await supabase.storage
  .from('business_photos')
  .upload(`${userId}/storefront.jpg`, photoFile);

// 2. Save record
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('business_photos')
  .insert({
    user_id: userId,
    photo_url: file.path,
    photo_type: 'storefront',
    is_primary: true
  });
```
